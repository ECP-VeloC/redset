Redundancy schemes
==================

SINGLE
++++++
With the SINGLE redundancy scheme,
redset keeps a single copy of each file.
It tracks meta data for application files,
but no redundancy data are stored.
The communicator in the redundancy descriptor
is a duplicate of MPI_COMM_SELF.

The lack of data redundancy prevents SINGLE
from recovering data in cases where access to storage is lost,
though many failures in practice do not impact storage accessibility.
This scheme is also effective when writing to storage that is highly reliable.

A descriptor is stored as a kvtree in the header of a redundancy file for SINGLE,
which records meta data about the files written by the calling process.

An example of the header in a SINGLE redundancy file is shown below::

  DESC
    0
      DESC
        ENABLED = 1
        GROUP = 0
        GROUPS = 4
        RANK = 0
        RANKS = 1
        TYPE = SINGLE
        WRANK = 0
        WRANKS = 4
      FILE
        0
          ./testfile_0.out
            ATIME_NSECS = 924124298
            ATIME_SECS = 1596606911
            CTIME_NSECS = 918124338
            CTIME_SECS = 1596606911
            GID = 12345
            MODE = 33152
            MTIME_NSECS = 918124338
            MTIME_SECS = 1596606911
            SIZE = 4194304
            UID = 12345
      FILES = 1
  RANK = 0

The topmost DESC section lists the file meta data for the owning process.
Entries in this section are indexed by rank within the redundancy group.
For SINGLE, this section will only contain information for the local process.

The DESC section under that provides details about the redundancy scheme and the redundancy set.
It lists the scheme in TYPE.
GROUPS specifies the number of redundancy groups.
GROUP specifies the group id that the process belongs to,
RANKS specifies the size of that group,
and RANK specifies the rank of the process within the group.
WRANKS gives the global number of ranks,
and WRANK records the global rank of the process.

Meta data about the files is shown after that.
For a given process, the number of files that process wrote is listed under FILES
and a ordered list of meta data for each file under the FILE kvtree.
Each file is assigned an integer index, counting up from 0,
which specifies the order in which the files were given in ``redset_apply``.
The meta data for each file is then recorded under the filename,
which includes the file size and other information like timestamps and permissions encoded from a stat call.

The topmost RANK key gives the rank of the process within its redundancy set.
Each redundancy set in SINGLE consists of one rank.

The SINGLE redundancy file is named of the form::

  <prefix><rank>.single.grp_<group_id>_of_<group_num>.mem_<group_rank>_of_<group_size>.redset

PARTNER
+++++++
With PARTNER, full replicas of all source files from the calling process are copied to other processes.
The number of replicas is defined by the caller,
but it must be at least one and at most one less than the number of processes in the redundancy set.
Partner processes are selected from different failure groups than the calling process,
so that it is unlikely for a process and each of its partners to fail at the same time.

When creating the redundancy descriptor,
redset splits the parent communicator into subcommunicators
each of which contains at most one process from each failure group.
Within this communicator, each process sends its files to processes wit higher ranks,
and each process stores the replicas of files for processes having lower ranks.
Processes at the end of the communicator wrap back to the beginning.

The meta data for each source file is transferred and stored in addition to the file data.
The meta data is stored in a kvtree in the header of the PARTNER redundancy file,
and file data are appended after the header as binary data.
All data for the partner to the immediate left is stored first,
followed by all data for the next partner to the left and so on.

An example of the header kvtree in a PARTNER redundancy file is shown below::

  DESC
    0
      DESC
        ENABLED = 1
        GROUP = 0
        GROUPS = 1
        RANK = 0
        RANKS = 4
        REPLICAS = 2
        TYPE = PARTNER
        WRANK = 0
        WRANKS = 4
      FILE
        0
          ./testfile_0.out
            ATIME_NSECS = 488905501
            ATIME_SECS = 1596608041
            CTIME_NSECS = 484905527
            CTIME_SECS = 1596608041
            GID = 12345
            MODE = 33152
            MTIME_NSECS = 484905527
            MTIME_SECS = 1596608041
            SIZE = 4194304
            UID = 12345
      FILES = 1
    3
      DESC
        ENABLED = 1
        GROUP = 0
        GROUPS = 1
        RANK = 3
        RANKS = 4
        REPLICAS = 2
        TYPE = PARTNER
        WRANK = 3
        WRANKS = 4
      FILE
        0
          ./testfile_3.out
            ATIME_NSECS = 494674123
            ATIME_SECS = 1596608041
            CTIME_NSECS = 486674153
            CTIME_SECS = 1596608041
            GID = 12345
            MODE = 33152
            MTIME_NSECS = 486674153
            MTIME_SECS = 1596608041
            SIZE = 7340032
            UID = 12345
      FILES = 1
  RANK = 0

The topmost DESC section records file meta data for the calling process and
for each process for which it stores partner copies.
This meta data is indexed by the rank of each process within its redundancy group.

The DESC section for each process is similar to SINGLE, except for an added REPLICAS field to record the number of PARTNER replicas.

The file meta data for each process is listed as described for SINGLE.

As with SINGLE, a topmost RANK entry in the header records the rank of the process within its redundancy set.

The partner file is named of the form::

  <prefix><rank>.partner.grp_<group_id>_of_<group_num>.mem_<group_rank>_of_<group_size>.redset

XOR
+++
The XOR redundancy scheme divides the processes into sets.
Each process in a set computes and stores redundancy data in an XOR redundancy file.

The XOR redundancy scheme can recover all files for any single member of a set.
If any set loses files for two or more processes,
the XOR redundancy scheme cannot recover all files.

The processes within each set are ordered,
and each process has a rank in the set, counting up from 0.
The process whose rank in the set is one less than the rank of the current process is called the left neighbor,
and the process whose rank is one more is the right neighbor.
The last rank wraps back to the first to form a ring.
At run time, the library caches the XOR set in the MPI communicator associated with a redundancy descriptor.
Each process also caches information about its left and right neighbor processes in the redundancy descriptor.

XOR algorithm
-------------
The XOR redundancy scheme applies the algorithm described in [Gropp]_ (which implements RAID-5 from [Patterson]_).
Assuming that each process writes one file and that the files on all processes are the same size,
this algorithm is illustrated in Figure fig-xor_.
Given N processes in the set, each file is logically partitioned into N-1 chunks,
and an empty, zero-padded chunk is logically inserted into the file at alternating
positions depending on the rank of the process.
A reduce-scatter is computed across the set of logical files using a byte-wise XOR operation.
The resulting chunk from this reduce-scatter is the data that the process stores in its redundancy file.

.. _fig-xor:

.. figure:: fig/xor.png

.. XOR Reduce Scatter

In general, each process in the set may write a different number of files,
and the size of each file may be arbitrary.
Figure fig-xor-general_ illustrates how to extend the algorithm to this general case.
First, all files from a process are logically concatenated into a single file.
The minimum chunk size is then computed such that N-1 chunks are equal to or larger than the largest logical file in the set.
Finally, the end of each logical file is padded with zero bytes
so that each logical file extends to the number of bytes contained in N-1 chunks.
This method is most efficient when all processes write the same amount of data.

.. _fig-xor-general:

.. figure:: fig/xor_general.png

.. Extension to multiple files

The redset implementation internally uses an abstraction called redset_lofi (logical file)
that treats an ordered set of physical files as a single logical file.
This abstraction implements open, read, write, and close functions to operate on a logical file.
To read from this logical file, redset_lofi calls redset_read_pad_n()
which takes input arrays of file names, file sizes, and opened file descriptors for each physical file,
as well as an offset and the number of bytes to read.
It returns data as though the set of physical files are concatenated as a
single file in the order given by the input arrays.
The read operation also pads the end of the logical file with zero bytes
if the read extends past the amount of physical data.
There is a corresponding redset_write_pad_n() function to write to a logical file.
These functions are implemented in redset_lofi.c.

Thus redset operates as though each process has exactly one file
where each file has the same length and is evenly divisible by N-1.
The reduce-scatter implementation achieves the following goals:
  - Evenly distribute work among all processes in the set.
  - Structure communication so that a process always receives data from its immediate left neighbor and sends data to its immediate right neighbor to reduce network contention.
  - Read data from each file once and write data to each XOR redundancy file once to minimize file accesses.
  - Operate on the data in small pieces so that the working set fits within the processor cache.

To accomplish this, each chunk is divided into a series of smaller pieces, and the pieces are operated on in phases.
The reduce-scatter result is computed for the first piece across all chunks and then written to the redundancy file.
Then the reduce-scatter result is computed for the second piece across all chunks, and so on.
In each phase, the reduce-scatter computation is pipelined among the processes.
The first phase of this reduce-scatter algorithm is illustrated in Figure fig-reduce-scatter_.
This algorithm is implemented in redset_apply_xor() in redset_xor.c.

XOR file
--------
The XOR redundancy file contains a header stored as a kvtree
followed by the XOR chunk data stored as binary data.
The header provides file information for the calling process
and the group of processes that belong to its XOR set.
A copy of the meta data for a process's files is also stored
in the header of the XOR file written by the process's right neighbor.

An example header is shown below::

  CHUNK = 2446678
  DESC
    0
      DESC
        ENABLED = 1
        GROUP = 0
        GROUPS = 1
        RANK = 0
        RANKS = 4
        TYPE = XOR
        WRANK = 0
        WRANKS = 4
      FILE
        0
          ./testfile_0.out
            ATIME_NSECS = 510882
            ATIME_SECS = 1596609195
            CTIME_NSECS = 995510916
            CTIME_SECS = 1596609194
            GID = 12345
            MODE = 33152
            MTIME_NSECS = 995510916
            MTIME_SECS = 1596609194
            SIZE = 4194304
            UID = 12345
      FILES = 1
    3
      DESC
        ENABLED = 1
        GROUP = 0
        GROUPS = 1
        RANK = 3
        RANKS = 4
        TYPE = XOR
        WRANK = 3
        WRANKS = 4
      FILE
        0
          ./testfile_3.out
            ATIME_NSECS = 2659263
            ATIME_SECS = 1596609195
            CTIME_NSECS = 994659293
            CTIME_SECS = 1596609194
            GID = 12345
            MODE = 33152
            MTIME_NSECS = 994659293
            MTIME_SECS = 1596609194
            SIZE = 7340032
            UID = 12345
      FILES = 1
  GROUP
    RANK
      0 = 0
      1 = 1
      2 = 2
      3 = 3
    RANKS = 4
  RANK = 0

The size of the XOR chunk in number of bytes is specified in the CHUNK field.

The topmost DESC section provides the file meta data for the calling process and its left neighbor.
These are indexed by the rank of each process within its redundancy group.
This is used similarly as described for the corresponding section in SINGLE.

The GROUP kvtree records the set of processes in the redundancy set.
The number of processes in the set is listed under the RANKS field,
and a mapping of a process's rank within its group to its global rank within the parent communicator is stored under the RANK kvtree.

The topmost RANK field records the rank of the calling process within its group.

The XOR redundancy file name is of the form::

  <prefix><rank>.xor.grp_<group_id>_of_<group_num>.mem_<group_rank>_of_<group_size>.redset

XOR rebuild
-----------
During a rebuild, the processes in each set check whether there are missing files, and if so, whether they can be rebuilt.
If any set determines that files cannot be recovered, the rebuild operation fails.
If a rebuild is needed and is possible, the processes identify the rank in the set that needs to rebuild its files.
The redset library implements an XOR reduction algorithm that achieves the same goals
as the reduce-scatter described earlier.
Namely, the implementation attempts to distribute work evenly among all processes,
minimize network contention, and minimize file accesses.
This algorithm is implemented in redset_recover_xor() in redset_xor.c.
An example is illustrated in Figure fig-xor-reduce_.

Reed-Solomon
++++++++++++
The RS redundancy scheme applies a Reed-Solomon encoding across the files of the redundancy set.
It can recover up to ``k`` failures in the group.
In the description below, assume:

- ``p`` processes per redundancy set
- ``B`` bytes per process
- ``k`` encoding blocks, where ``1 <= k < p``
- ``m`` failures, where ``m <= k``

The implementation uses Galois Fields of 2^8,
which requires that ``(p + k) <= 256``.
Some useful references for understanding Reed-Solomon encoding and arithmetic with Galois Fields:

- `An Introduction to Galois Fields and Reed-Solomon Coding <https://people.cs.clemson.edu/~westall/851/rs-code.pdf>`_
- `A Tutorial on Reed-Solomon Coding for Fault-Tolerance in RAID-like Systems <http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/papers/CS-96-332.pdf>`_
- `Note: Correction to the 1997 Tutorial on Reed-Solomon Coding <http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/papers/CS-03-504.pdf>`_

In short, a ``(p + k) x p`` encoding matrix is constructed, where the top ``p x p`` portion is an identity matrix,
and the bottom ``k`` rows give the encoding coefficients for each of the ``k`` checksum blocks.
For each checksum row, each process multiplies its data by the coefficient that corresponds to its column in the matrix.
Since the algorithm is implemented with GF(2^8), operations are executed in units of bytes.

To decode, the missing processes are first identified.
Then one chooses any ``m`` distinct rows from the encoding matrix which gives ``m`` equations for ``m`` unknowns.
The coefficients of the rows in the encoding matrix corresponding to the ``m`` missing processes lead to an ``m x m`` matrix,
which is reduced to an ``m x m`` identity matrix via Gaussian elimination to recover the missing data.

Addition and subtraction for GF(2^8) amounts to XOR.
Multiplication and division of two elements is accomplished through table look ups.
Matrix operations like Gaussian elimination follow the normal rules of linear algebra.

RS encode
---------
The RS algorithm is an extension of the approach described for XOR,
where each process stores ``k`` encoding chunks instead of 1 XOR chunk.
As with the XOR scheme, Reed-Solomon concatenates and pads logical files as shown in Figure fig-rs-general_.

.. _fig-rs-general

.. figure:: fig/rs_general.png

.. Reed-Solomon intersperses k checksum blocks into logical files based on process rank

The algorithm to compute the checksum data is shown in Figure fig-rs-encode_.
Each process writes a piece of each of its checksum blocks every (p-k) steps.
In each step, each process reads data from its files, sends data to k processes, and receives data from k processes.
Each process encodes the received data based on the encoding matrix coefficients for the corresponding sending rank and checksum block.
The time complexity for computing the encoding is ``O(B * k)``,
and the additional space required to store the redundancy data scales as ``O(k * B / (p - k))``.

.. _fig-rs-encode

.. figure:: fig/rs_encode.png

.. Reed-Solomon parallel encode

RS rebuild
----------
The algorithm to rebuild lost files is illustrated in Figure fig-rs-decode_.
All processes in the group participate to recover missing data
so that recovery cost does not increase with the group size ``p`` for large enough ``B``.
Recovery time for ``m`` failures (where ``m <= k``) scales as ``O(m^2 * B / (p - k) + B)``.
The decode cost involves Gaussian elimination to solve an ``m x m`` matrix,
which takes ``m^2`` steps with each step requiring ``B / (p - k)`` operations.
Each process that is missing files must then receive its full ``B`` bytes after decoding.

RS file
-------
The RS redundancy file contains a header stored as a kvtree followed by the RS checksum chunk data stored as binary data.
The checksum chunks are appended in order immediately following the header.
The header provides file information for the calling process and the group of processes that belong to the redundancy set.
A process also stores copies of the meta data for each of its ``k`` left-most neighbors.

An example header stored in the RS redundancy file is shown below::

The contents of this header are similar to those described in XOR,
with the notable difference being that it records the number of encoding blocks in ``CKSUM`` under ``DESC``.

The RS redundancy file name is of the form::

  <prefix><rank>.rs.grp_<group_id>_of_<group_num>.mem_<group_rank>_of_<group_size>.redset
